Ask in stackoverflow: 
	Â¿Which trading platform can I use to test a trading bot?
	This platform must have the following requirements:
	-Trading API (REST)
	-Demo account
	-FOREX currencies trading like: EURUSD

I have been trying coinsbit.io, and the API is very good. However, I still cannot find a demo account 
option and I just see Crypto Currencies availables for trading.
