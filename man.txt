NAME
	tra4me

SYNOPSIS
	tra4me.py <config-file> <options>

DESCRIPTION
	tra4me comes from the phrase "Trade for me".

	This is a program to do trading operations in exchange platforms, 
	utilizing REST API. This software is currently in development
	stage.

OPTIONS:
	--config <inifile>
		Path to the configuration file. This must be in INI configuration format. 
		See the "CONFIGURATION FILE" section to learn about this file.

	--verbose	
		Outputs information about every action performed by the bot.
		
	--test-data <csvfile>
		Executes a testing with historical data. After this parameter a path to a CSV file
		must be specified. Such file must contain a historical price. See the TEST CSV FILE
		section to know the file syntax.
		When this parameter is used the bot will behave in "advice" mode, giving an output 
		of the operation that would be performed for such data in a specific moment,
		and then it will stop.
		Example:
			The parameter: 
				--test-data /path/to/file.csv
			Would give the following output:
				Processing ...

				Test BEGIN_________________

				28-03-2020 09:16:05    BUY
				28-03-2020 09:20:29    BUY
				28-03-2020 10:06:19    SELL
				28-03-2020 10:26:08    SELL
				28-03-2020 10:31:10    BUY

				Test END___________________

		This option allows you to know how effective the strategy could be, 
		so you can adjust it. To do a more accurate test, it is adviced to know
		what the correct answer would be before execute the test.

TEST CSV FILE
	The test file is CSV file. It contains two columns of data.
	
	The expected column separator is the comma: ,
	The comma cannot be used in float values inside this file. 
	This is importan to avoid errors in the test process.
	
	The expected row separator is the line jump.

	The fist column is a string that defines a date-time value, 
	with the folowing format: 
	
	YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS 
	
	Example: 2016-11-16 00:00:00

	The second column is a float value, that defines a price.
	The decimal separator must be the point
	
	Example: 685.91

	An example of a valid line of the CSV file would be:
	
	2016-11-16 00:00:00,711.73 (This is a Bitcoin price sample taken from blockchain.com)

CONFIGURATION FILE
	The configuration file is an INI file that define the parameters the bot needs
	to operate. Most parameters are mandatory and it is defined as follows:

	owner		(string) The full name of the person that owns the bot.
				Example:
				owner = John Doe

	mode		(string) Defines how the bot behaves and the range of his actions.
				The value must be one of the next:
				advice:		The bot just outputs the operation that it would be executed.
							No operation is executed in this mode
							This mode is meant to be a support tool for the human trader.
				
				automata:	The bot will be self sufficient and will execute real operations,
							using your credentials.

	workdir		(string) The path of a directory in which the bot will create its
				log files and other necessary files.
				If this directory does not exists the program will output an error
				notifying this.
				Example:
				logdir = /home/username/tra4me-dir

	strategy	(string) The strategy used by the bot to decide which operation must
				be executed. So far these are the available strategies:
					
					"mean-reversion"	A strategy based on the existence of an average value
										for the price, to which it can return to. The analytics
										uses a moving average approach.
	
	tp			(integer) This is the Take Profit parameter. It is a number of PIP's.
				The BUY operation will be closed once the price reaches a value 
				bigger or equal to the entrance price plus the tp.
				The SELL operation will be closed once the price reaches a value 
				smaller or equal to the entrance price plus the tp.
	
	sl			(integer) This is the Stop Loss parameter. It is a number of PIP's.
				The BUY operation will be closed once the price reaches a value 
				smaller or equal to the entrance price plus the tp.
				The SELL operation will be closed once the price reaches a value 
				bigger or equal to the entrance price plus the tp.
	
	lote		(float) The lote indicating the profit.

	platform	(string) The trading plattform or broker.
				So far there is only one possible value:
				"coinsbit.io".

	apikey		(string) The trading plattform API Key.

	apisecret	(string) The trading platform API secret.
